I have enhanced the Chat UI with Markdown rendering using `ink-markdown` and refined the `Footer` component for a cleaner, borderless look. These changes, combined with the previous structural refactor, bring the interface closer to the polished experience of the Gemini CLI TUI.

**Summary of Changes:**
*   **Markdown Support:** Added `ink-markdown` to render AI responses with proper formatting (bold, italic, code blocks, etc.).
*   **Footer Refinement:** Updated the `Footer` component to be borderless and use `inverse` styling for keys, reducing visual noise and aligning with modern CLI aesthetics.
*   **Message Bubbles:** Updated to use `Markdown` component for content rendering.
